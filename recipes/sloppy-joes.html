    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When the craving for a reliable, nostalgic, easy (and cheap) weeknight 
        dinner hits, there’s no debate: A sloppy Joes’ night is in order. 
        The perfect answer to, “How far can I stretch this package of 
        ground beef?” sloppy Joes only require a handful of simple 
        ingredients (that you most likely already have on hand) to create a 
        classic family dinner. Our tried-and-tested recipe uses the 
        unstoppable sloppy Joes trio—ground beef, tomato flavors, and 
        onion—to create a flavor-packed meal that’s for way more than just 
        sandwiches.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li><strong>1 tbsp.</strong> extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li><strong>1 </strong>medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li><strong>1 </strong>red bell pepper, seeds and ribs removed, chopped</li>
            <li><strong>1/2 c.</strong>ketchup</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong>cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li><strong>1 tbsp.</strong>chili powder</li>
            <li><strong>2 tbsp.</strong> apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li><strong>2 tbsp.</strong> yellow mustard</li>
            <li><strong>1 tbsp.</strong> brown sugar</li>
            <li><strong>1 tbsp.</strong> Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li><strong></strong>Kosher salt</li>
            <li><strong></strong>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li><strong>1 lb.</strong> ground beef</li>
            <li><strong>1 c.</strong>canned tomato sauce</li>
            <li><strong>6</strong> hamburger buns, toasted</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. 
                Cook onion and bell pepper, stirring occasionally, 
                until softened and slightly golden, 10 to 15 minutes </li>

            <li>Add ketchup and cook, stirring occasionally, 
                until color has darkened and ketchup is reduced 
                to a thick paste, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>

            <li>Add garlic and chili powder and cook, 
                stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
                Add vinegar, mustard, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce; 
                season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 
                until incorporated, about 1 minute more.</li>

            <li>Increase heat to high and add ground beef. 
                Using a fork, break apart beef until separated and no 
                big lumps remain. Cook, stirring frequently, 
                until browned, about 5 minutes.</li>

            <li>Add tomato sauce and bring to a boil, stirring to combine. 
                Let cool slightly; season with salt, if needed.</li>

            <li>Divide beef mixture among buns and serve.</li>
